THEORY:-
NFS (Network File Share) is a protocol that allows you to share directories and files with other Linux clients in a network. 
The directory to be shared is usually created on the NFS server and files added to it.
The client systems mount the directory residing on the NFS server, which grants them access to the files created.
NFS comes in handy when you need to share common data among client systems especially when they are running out of space.

Steps:-
Install NFS Kernel Server in Ubuntu
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
Create an NFS Export Directory
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_share
Give permissions
$ sudo chmod 777 /mnt/nfs_share/
Grant NFS Share Access to Client Systems
$ sudo vim /etc/exports
/mnt/nfs_share  192.168.43.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
To grant access to client
/mnt/nfs_share  client_IP_1 (re,sync,no_subtree_check)
Export the NFS Share Directory
$ sudo exportfs -a
$ sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
Allow NFS Access through the Firewall
$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.43.0/24 to any 2049
enable the firewall
$ sudo ufw enable
$ sudo ufw status
Install the NFS-Common Package
$ sudo apt install nfs-common
Create a NFS Mount Point on Client
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_clientshare
Mount NFS Share on Client System
$ ifconfig
$ sudo mount 192.168.43.234:/mnt/nfs_share  /mnt/nfs_clientshare
 Testing the NFS Share on Client System
 $ cd /mnt/nfs_share/
$ touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
$ ls -l /mnt/nfs_clientshare/
