Theory:-
In Linux, the Secure Shell (SSH) is a method where you can access another computer through a secure and two-way encrypted communication system over the internet. 
By enabling the SSH service in Linux, you can use the SSH protocol as an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server or, you can get remote access to another Pc. 
Enabling SSH service can connect your device to another device or server through a secure tunnel where your identity and data transmissions are totally safe and encrypted.
If you are a network administrator, you must know how to enable and configure the SSH service in Linux.

Step 1:-
Install openssh-server package.
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install openssh-server
Step 2:-
Configure firewall to allow ssh traffic
$ sudo ufw allow ssh
Step 3:-
Check if ssh service automatically started and is running.
$ sudo systemctl status ssh
Step 4:-
Start the ssh service if it's not already started.
$ sudo systemctl start ssh
Step 5:-
Disable ssh from automatically started during system boot if required. 
$ sudo systemctl disable ssh
Configure SSH server to automaticall start during system boot if required
$ sudo systemctl enable ssh
Configure SSH server options by editing the configuration file using your favorite editor. 
$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Restart SSH service for any changes to take effect. 
$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
