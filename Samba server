Theory:-
A Samba file server enables file sharing across different operating systems over a network.
It lets you access your desktop files from a laptop and share files with Windows and macOS users.

Open the terminal
Install samba with the following command:   sudo apt-get install samba smbfs
Configure samba typing: vi /etc/samba/smb.conf
Set your workgroup (if necesary). Go down in the file, until you see :

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = WORKGROUP
Set your share folders.
# Ubaid's share
[MyShare]
  comment = YOUR COMMENTS
  path = /your-share-folder
  read only = no
  guest ok = yes
start samba. type: /etc/init.d/smbd restart
Create the share folder: sudo mkdir /your-share-folder
Set the permissions: sudo chmod 0777 /your-share-folder
you are all set in ubuntu
sudo service smbd restart
Update the firewall rules to allow Samba traffic:
sudo ufw allow samba
Accessing Samba Server Files from:Windows
art button -> Run
Type: \\<your-ip-address-to-ubuntu>\<your-share-folder>
All set
If you need to enable the samba ports in your firewall these are the ports:

port type    port no
udp        137
udp        138
tcp        139
tcp        445
